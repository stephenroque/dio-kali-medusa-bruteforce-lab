# 🔐 Mitigation Measures Against Brute Force Attacks

Based on the attacks simulated in this lab, several common weaknesses were identified
in poorly configured services. The following mitigation measures are recommended:

## 1. Strong Password Policies
- Use long and complex passwords;
- Avoid predictable or reused passwords;
- Encourage the use of password managers.

## 2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Add an additional authentication layer;
- Significantly reduces the impact of credential compromise.

## 3. Login Attempt Limitation
- Implement rate limiting;
- Temporary account lockout after multiple failed attempts;
- Protection against automated attacks.

## 4. Monitoring and Logging
- Monitor failed login attempts;
- Analyze suspicious patterns;
- Automated alerts for anomalous activity.

## 5. IDS / IPS
- Use intrusion detection and prevention systems;
- Automatically block suspicious IP addresses.

## 6. Service Hardening
- Disable unnecessary services;
- Keep systems and applications up to date;
- Restrict access using firewalls.

## 7. Security Awareness
- User training;
- Well-defined security policies;
- Strong information security culture.
